Hi <name>,

We haven't had the opportunity to have a formal introduction - beyond being in calls together.Â It would be great to have an introduction call with you to get to know you better and your ways of working. I will be conducting these with each of the Omega team members, aiming to build a better picture of how the group operates and preferences that the team has.

Feel free to move this time around if it is not suitable for you.

Many thanks,

Sarvesh
